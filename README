Dining_Philosophers
1. Implementation of the dining philosophers problem
2. Solution to the dining philosophers problem using resource hiarchy


To use with MDAT:
- Make libmdat.a and suds and place in current directory.
- Alter mdat and suds directories in Makefile.

To test:
./run-mdat.py -R <runs> -t <threads> -r <rounds> -m <mode (1 or 2)>
R: number of repetition
t: amount of threads, must be at least 2 as the dining philosopher problem requires at least 2 philosophers
r: number of rounds (going through the cycle of picking up forks -> eat -> put down forks -> think)
m: mode, 1 will test section1 and 2 will test section2
